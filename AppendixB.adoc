[appendix]
= Licenses

The link:https://dreamsongs.com/IHE/IHE-90.html[online version] of _Innovation Happens Elsewhere_ includes the full text of all licenses mentioned in the book.
Reproducing them here provides little value for the amount of work it would take to properly format them.
Instead, you may find links to licenses in <<licenses,Appendix A>>.
