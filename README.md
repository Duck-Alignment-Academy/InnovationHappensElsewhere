# Innovation Happens Elsewhere

This project reproduces [*Innovation Happens Elsewhere: Open Source as Business Strategy*](https://dreamsongs.com/IHE/) by Ron Goldman & Richard P. Gabriel.
The online version is only available in multi-page HTML, which is not well-suited for offline reading.
I created this project to reproduce the book in portable formats.

*This project does not exist to update, edit, or otherwise modify the content of the book.*
Undoubtedly, many things have changed since this book was published in 2005.
