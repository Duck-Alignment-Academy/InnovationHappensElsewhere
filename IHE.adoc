== About This Edition

This book is a reproduction of https://dreamsongs.com/IHE/[_Innovation Happens Elsewhere: Open Source as Business Strategy_] by Ron Goldman and Richard P. Gabriel.
The original was published in 2005 under the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license] (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0), but only in a multi-page HTML format.
Since this format is not particularly well-suited for me to load on my tablet and read on an airplane, I built into a format that allows easy production of PDF and ePUB files.

Although the original book is, at the time of publication, almost two decades old, I am not updating the content.
I have made formatting and style changes where necessary to appease the toolchain, or where it improves the readability.
I may choose to take that on at a later date.
More likely, I'll write about what I find relevant (and irrelevant) at https://duckalignment.academy[Duck Alignment Academy (https://duckalignment.academy)].
